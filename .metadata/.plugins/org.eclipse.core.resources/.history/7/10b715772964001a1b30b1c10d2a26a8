hellotoall

notes:
******
StringBuffer is a synchronize whereas 
StringBuilder is a non synchronize. 

**question)
what is difference between String and StringBuffer ?

 String()                     StringBuffer()
 ******                       **************     
 immutable 					   mutable

 equals() and					equals() & hashCode()						
 hashCode method                are not over rided
 are over rided

 note:
 *****
 In StringBuffer as equals() and hashCode() are not over rided,
 it can't compare content of the objects.
 
 it is implementing 			whereas here it is not implementing
 comparable interface.          comparable interface.

 as we can compare with
 the comparable interface, 
 it is possible to sorting
 based on the content.
